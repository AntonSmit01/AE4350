## Pseudo Code ##

### This is the main file where you can play the game ###

## Pseudo Code ##

# 1. Initialize game
    # create_deck() -> list of cards
    # create_players(num_players=4) -> list of Player objects

# 2. Shuffle and deal cards to each player

# 3. Optionally: check 'vuile was'
    # if all players agree: allow card exchange

# 4. Loop over rounds
    # For each trick (4 per round):
        # Players play a card in order
        # Track trick winner
    # Determine round winner

# 5. Handle 'toep' (raising)
    # Players can choose to raise
    # Other players decide to follow or fold
    # Update lives or points accordingly

# 6. Update game state
    # track lives / remaining players

# 7. Repeat until game ends (1 player left or a max score/loss reached)

# 8. Integrate RL agent (Player A)
    # Observe state
    # Choose action
    # Receive reward
    # Train/update policy or Q-values


# Use a point tracker to keep data (per round, but also in total to see if Player A is learning)

# First make sure the game works first, after this the RL algorythm comes into play
